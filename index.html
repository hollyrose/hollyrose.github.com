				<header><h1>Who let the dogs out?</h1></header>
				<p>I realy like dogs and I'm hoping that one day in the not too distant future, I will be able to realise my lifelong dream of owning a dog.</p>
				<p>Recently I have been trying to improve my digital painting skills so I decided to try and combine my love of dogs with my desire to paint better. 
				This has resulted in multiple weekly speedpaints of various kinds of dog.</p>
				<p>Effectively I would like to showcase a few of these examples here and hopefully over time an improvement in my skills will become noticeable!</p>
